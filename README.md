# Perceiving Humans in 3D

This repository contains the code for two research projects:

1. **MonStereo: When Monocular and Stereo Meet at the Tail of 3D Human Localization**   
[README](https://github.com/vita-epfl/monstereo/tree/master/docs/MonStereo.md) & [Article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10913)

2.  **Perceiving Humans: from Monocular 3D Localization to Social Distancing (MonoLoco++)**         
 [README](https://github.com/vita-epfl/monstereo/tree/master/docs/MonoLoco_pp.md) & [Article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00984)

Both projects has been built upon [Openpifpaf](https://github.com/vita-epfl/openpifpaf) 
for 2D pose estimation and [MonoLoco](https://github.com/vita-epfl/monoloco) for monocular 3D localization. 
All projects share the AGPL Licence.
